It seems we would need a screen for those who chose to use the app to input their information. 

-hours
-address ( which would need confirmation and a screen to show success using Google Maps )
-extra information like No Sex Offenders Above 32 Degrees and even then it's the floor
-some quick and dirty legal framework saying that anyone who downloaded and deployed the app
   was doing so of their own volition.
-available beds, of course, the whole point was availability

It seems that almost no one will be turned away late, which kind of cheapens the effort, 
  but it still seems like a worth while pursuit. 

Other places to try.
