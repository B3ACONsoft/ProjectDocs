1. How are statistics gathered on homeless people who come through shelters? Is the method uniform?


2. Is there a connection between the shelters in terms of databases or paper trails?


3. Are singular profiles kept on families or individuals? 


4. What, if any, blocks the homeless from receiving shelter or services?


5. Tom Cooper was very nice. He told me that an attempt to link all the local databases failed and no one
has tried since. He said that I could call him whenever for 10 minutes of enightenment and he would try to find 
time. He said that they had a database for donors and a database for clients. (He called them that) They use 
Microsoft Databases. 

---URBAN MINISTRIES UPDATE---
6. Urban Ministries came off as unenlightened. A "fillin" person told me that they had an IT person and didn't
need any services we might offer them. Like a wall she was. I figured there was no arguing for time she wouldn't
part with so I left. Now I'm trying to figure out who their IT guy is and get at it sideways (as nicely as possible)
